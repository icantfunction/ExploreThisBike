# ExploreThisBike
Exploratory Data Visualization 

This piece of code is only to demonstrate the exploratory part of Data Analysis in which I will use to prove or disprove a hypothesis of when people like to rent out bikes more, on the weekdays or on the weekends. 

We will using this data from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) specifcally for Capitol Bikes, and in Washington D.C. to  make some basic observations that will lead us to answer the following questions:
* What deals could we offer to increase sales volume?
* What weather conditions have made our company successful, and if we launch somewhere else, what conditions should we look for?

This analysis will be using data visulization and these additional libraries:
* pandas
* matplotlib
